## 1. Executive Summary

**NativeUI** is a **no-code/low-code platform** enabling teams to design, deploy, and scale AI-native user interfaces in minutes. With a **visual drag-and-drop builder** and prebuilt templates, users connect **nodes** (*triggers*, *models*, *events*, *actions*) to create workflows without coding. NativeUI compiles these workflows into production-ready components integrated with LLMs and enterprise data sources, reducing **time-to-market** and costs by **~70%**.

---

## 2. Vision & Mission

- **Vision**: To be the universal presentation layer for AI-driven applications.  
- **Mission**: Empower non-frontend teams to deliver secure, scalable, and delightful conversational experiences.

---

## 3. Problem & Opportunity

| **Pain Point** | **Impact** |
|----------------|------------|
| Resource-intensive frontend development | Long cycles & budget overruns |
| Scarcity of AI + UX talent | Adoption bottlenecks |
| Complex integrations (e.g., OpenAI, SAP) | Technical complexity & risks |

**Opportunity**: A **vertical platform** unifying design, LLM logic, and operations, enabling launches in days instead of months.

## 4. Product

### 4.1 Core Components

1. **NativeFlow**: Visual workflow builder with nodes (trigger, model, event, action) and ready-made templates.  
2. **NativeUI Studio**: Prompt-to-UI drag-and-drop editor.  
3. **NativeConnect**: Prebuilt connectors (e.g., OpenAI, Azure AI, Salesforce, Chainlink).  
4. **NativeDeploy**: Serverless hosting with auto-scaling and global CDN.  
5. **NativeMarket**: Marketplace for UI components, themes, and pretrained agents.  
6. **NativeAI**: Proprietary engine compiling prompts or NativeFlow graphs into optimized code (React, Web Components, Flutter).

### 4.2 Key Differentiators

- Real-time collaborative editing and preview.  
- Bundles **30% lighter** than general-purpose frameworks.  
- Enterprise-grade security (PII control, encryption, audit logs).  
- Optional Web3 modules (decentralized identity, token gating).
